# Uok Evaluation Admin

## About the project:
Course assessment tool is an online tool designed to improve or enhance evaluation and quality
assurance processes under education sector. The main purpose of this project is to keep the
quality assurance sector progress despite of the Corona Virus pandemic. As I/we already know
that there are several activities that the quality assurance sector is involved in a given university
such as evaluating instructors, courses, etc. This project is mainly for the course evaluation
process. But I believe we will not stop there.
### Users:
This project will be mainly used by students, though it has several stages in it, by stages I mean
the different user modules involved. The modules include:
Student module: The main section of data collection process i.e the mobile app that will be used
by the particular student for the survey/assessment. This module will contain all the required
questions.
### Admin module: 
The data analysis stage. This module consists of data/result presentation of the
data collected for a specific university. This process is done at the university level, which can be
the faculty level or department level. This module will also require account creation and
approval for one to manage the data.
### Tool Features:
When we dive deeper into specific functionalities of the tool and how each functionality will
help the project idea better, this is how they will be implemented:
### 1. User authentication:
on the student module will be through Google Sign in method. This
helps in verifying who the user is and the details provided are valid and on the admin
module on will be required to provide a valid email and password i.e an email
verification will be sent to the email also for verification.
### 2. Account creation: 
on the student module one is required to provide his/her academic
details that is:

 Provide university which he/she belong (in form of drop down)
 Provide course which he/she is studying (in form of drop down)
 Provide level of study which he/she is (in form of drop down)
 Provide faculty name which he/she belong (in form of drop down)
 Provide department name which he/she belong (in form of drop down)
 Provide year of study which he/she belong (in form of drop down)


On the admin module the user that is the person in charge at the university level for the quality
assurance is required several details:

 Provide university which he/she belong (in form of drop down)
 Provide faculty name which he/she belong (in form of drop down)
 Provide his/her email which is the organization email i.e work email for
verification and approval by the super admin(which will require valid
details for one o be approved)

### 3. Offline feature:

answers after submission even if there is no internet connection also they can navigate
through the app and change app language according to their preference.
